	abstract = {Epigenomics, the study of the human genome and its interactions with proteins and other cellular elements, has become of significant interest in recent years. Such interactions have been shown to regulate essential cellular functions and are associated with multiple complex diseases. Therefore, understanding how these interactions may change across conditions is central in biomedical research. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is one of several techniques to detect local changes in epigenomic activity (peaks). However, existing methods for differential peak calling are not optimized for the diversity in ChIP-seq signal profiles, are limited to the analysis of two conditions, or cannot classify specific patterns of differential change when multiple patterns exist. To address these limitations, we present a flexible and efficient method for the detection of differential epigenomic activity across multiple conditions. We utilize data from the ENCODE Consortium and show that the presented method, mixNBHMM, exhibits superior performance to current tools and it is among the fastest algorithms available. Our method also allows the classification of combinatorial patterns of differential epigenomic activity, and the characterization of chromatin regulatory states. Supplementary materials, including code to replicate the results, are available as an online supplement. The implemented R package is available for download at https://github.com/plbaldoni/mixNBHMM.},

abstract: Accurate power calculations are essential in small studies containing expensive experimental units or high-stakes exposures. Herein, exact power of the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney rank-sum test of a continuous variable is formulated using a Monte Carlo approach and defining P (X< Y)= p as a measure of effect size, where X and Y denote random observations from two distributions hypothesized to be equal under the null. Effect size p fosters productive communications because researchers understand p= 0.5 is analogous to a fair coin toss, and p near 0 or 1 represents a large effect. This approach is feasible even without background data. Simulations were conducted comparing the exact power approach to existing approaches by Rosner & Glynn (2009), Shieh et al.(2006), Noether (1987), and O'Brien-Castelloe (2006). Approximations by Noether and O'Brien-Castelloe are shown to be inaccurate for small sample sizes. The Rosner & Glynn and Shieh et al. approaches performed well in many small sample scenarios, though both are restricted to location-shift alternatives and neither approach is theoretically justified for small samples. The exact method is recommended and available in the R package wmwpow.

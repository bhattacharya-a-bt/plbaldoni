I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) and recipient of the [University Cancer Research Fund](https://unclineberger.org/ucrf/) award. My dissertation advisers are [Dr. Naim Rashid](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/naim-rashid-phd/) and [Dr. Joseph Ibrahim](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/joseph-g-ibrahim-phd/), with whom I develop statistical methods for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing epigenomic assays.

During my doctoral studies, I have collaborated as a graduate research assistant in the [Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)](https://sites.cscc.unc.edu/hchs/). Under direction of [Dr. Jianwen Cai](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/jianwen-cai-phd/) and [Dr. Daniela Sotres-Alvarez](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/daniela-sotres-alvarez-drph/), my research involved the development and application of statistical methods to analyze data from the HCHS/SOL under complex survey design settings.

I graduated from [University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english), Brazil, with BSc and MSc degrees in statistics in 2012 and 2014, respectively. After a period abroad at [University of Aarhus](https://international.au.dk/), Denmark, my MSc thesis concerned the application of generalized linear mixed models to study genetic and environmental factors associated with the prevalence of metritis in Danish Holstein cows.
